This table exposes a drastic inbalance between the sample-sizes across all classes. I'd expect that training on this dataset might lead to biased classification and weak recognition of classes with less examples.
For example the "Speed limit (20km/h)" as well as the "Go straight or left" sign is underrepresented in all three datasets.

In order to overcome a biased prediction I balanced the training dateset by equalizing the number of training examples per class.
As a reference count I used the count of the class which has the most samples (class 2, samples = 2010), because I didn't want to discard any samples from this class.
Having 2010 samples from all 43 classes leads to a training set of 86430 samples. In the random image autmentation later I make sure that all the samples which appear several times in the training set look different due to the augmentations.

The following article discusses another solution to an inbalanced training dataset, it penalizes the reward for the majority class, that means re-weighting the loss function:

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### Preprocessing pipeline

**Colorspaces considerations**
As the traffic signs are available as RGB images it makes sense to stick to RGB colorspace and use it for training.
Unlike other colorspaces RGB should give the trained network the same intuition as the human when it comes to color perception,
e.g. it make take advantage of the color-coding of particular signs as additional cues for the classification, besids the structure and patterns.

On the other hand using colorspaces which seperate the luminance (or brightness) from the chrominance (or colors) allow for tweaking the image contrast while not changing the colors. Therefore the YUV and LAB colorspaces were considered, where the luminance channel was used for adaptive histogram equalization using `cv2.createCLAHE` function, the color channels were left as is. My assumption was that the network would benefit from a better image contrast, extracting patterns and structure more easily.

**Image histogram equalization and normalization**
Using the function `cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit, tileGridSize)` I equalized the histograms of the luminance channels of the YUV and LAB colorspaces and the B/W images.
I tried to find suitable parameters for `clipLimit`, `tileGridSize` by plotting images where I keep `clipLimit` fixed and `tileGridSize` variable and vice versa.

Plot with `clipLimit=2` and variable `tileGridSize`:

Plot with `tileGridSize=(4,4)` and variable `clipLimit`

**Augmented dataset example**

The original dataset was augmented using `ImageDataGenerator` from `keras.preprocessing.image` in order to make the trained classifier more robost against deviations from the training dataset.
The following augmentations were applied:
* Rotations: [0, 20]Â°
* Image shifts in x and y axis: [0, 0.1] %
* Zoom: [0, 0.1] %

#### Model selection

The first choice of course was the recommended LeCun5 network from the course material.
It delivered a validation accuracy of around 90% while using unmodified training data but didn't really generalize well on new images.
Besides it was impossible to get a validation accuracy higher than approx. 80% on the augmented dataset.

In order to enable the network to learn more features and generalize better I added one more convolution + max pooling layer and increased the depth of the convolution layers.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		      |     Description                         | 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		      | 32x32x3 RGB image                       |
| Convolution           | kernel: 5x5, stride: 1x1, output: 32x32x32    |
| Max pooling           | kernel: 2x2, stride: 2x2, output: 16x16x32    |
| Convolution           | kernel: 5x5, stride: 1x1, output: 16x16x64    |
| Max pooling           | kernel: 2x2, stride: 2x2, output: 8x8x64     |
| Convolution           | kernel: 5x5, stride: 1x1, output: 8x8x128     |
| Max pooling           | kernel: 2x2, stride: 2x2, output: 4x4x128     |
| Fully connected       | input: 2048, output: 400                      |
| RELU                  |                                               |
| Dropout               | keep_prob: 0.6                                |
| Fully connected       | input: 400, output: 200                       |
| RELU                  |                                               |
| Dropout               | keep_prob: 0.6                                |

#### Training

optimizer:
the batch size: 
number of epochs:
learning rate:


####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of ?
* validation set accuracy of ? 
* test set accuracy of ?

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
* What were some problems with the initial architecture?
* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 

### Test a Model on New Images

#### Picking random German traffic signs from the web
Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![sign1] ![sign2] ![sign3] ![sign4] ![sign5] ![sign6] ![sign7] ![sign8]

The second and forth image might be difficult to classify correctly, because the second sign was slightly modified (head of person) andthe forth is strongly rotated.

#### Discussion of prediction results
the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

#### Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)


For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ...
